# GraphQL

## GraphQL Terms

**Query**
A prebuilt type for querying our data, more like a GET request in a REST API.

**Mutation**
A prebuilt type for manipulating our data. Every field in the Mutation type can be thought of as a POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH request in a REST API.

**Resolver**
A function that connects schema fields and types to various backends.

**Field**
A unit of data that belongs to a type in your schema.

You can learn more about all the terms from the [official GraphQL documentation](https://graphql.org/).
